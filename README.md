# App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.5.

## download and run localy 

unfortunately you will need to install "yarn" by using this command "npm install -g yarn". for node developing purposes then u can download all packages using "yarn install" command line .
after that feel free to run our project localy using "npm run start"

## Install the dependencies:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Explanation: When installing the project dependencies, you might encounter issues with peer dependencies, especially if there are version conflicts. The --legacy-peer-deps flag tells npm to ignore these peer dependency conflicts and proceed with the installation using the older dependency resolution method. This can help avoid installation errors in cases where the dependencies are not compatible with the strict peer dependency rules introduced in newer versions of npm.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
